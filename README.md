## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Running the Development Server

- To preview UI changes with hot reload (recommended for UI/component development):

  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```
  - Starts the Astro dev server at `http://localhost:4321`.
  - Only the frontend is available; API requests to the Worker will not work locally.

- To test the full stack (Astro + Cloudflare Worker API) locally:

  ```bash
  pnpm preview
  ```
  - Builds the site and starts both the static site and the Worker API using Wrangler.
  - Use this when you need to test API integration.

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```
- Outputs the production build to the `./dist/` directory.

### 4. Deploy

```bash
pnpm deploy:app
```
- Builds and deploys the app and Worker to Cloudflare.
